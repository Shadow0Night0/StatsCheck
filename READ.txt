#Data Science Final Project         Date:6/15/2022
#Created a system for users to check their stats from different games.
#Currently only 3 games are available to check(Valorant, Apex Legends, League of Legends)
#if you do not have an account for any of these games u can use the following usernames for testing
    #Valorant: Shadow0Night0#6666
    #League: Shadow0Night0  
    #Apex: Shadow0Night0
#note that the system sometimes give trouble, this is due to the webpage, so sometimes u just need to sumbit again to get the results.
